<h2> GASTR_Vn </h2>
GASTR (Genomic AnalysiS ToolbaR) is a work in progress and is still a private build. Access to this Github repo is strictly private. 

<h2> What's the point? </h2> 
Simply put, not everyone has the same programming capabilities. Because of this gap, we wanted to make a handful of tools that anyone can use. Collecting packages with useful contexts in computational biology, statistics, and creating a user-friendly interface from them. 
Additionally, if a tool has yet to be created for a set purpose, we set out to add it here too. 

<h2> Imports needed: </h2> 
The following imports are needed to ensure the program runs smoothly. Alternatively, you may extract the whole repo and run the xeq.exe file.
